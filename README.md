## Description

The following descriptions are taken from the course catalog

### Applied Statistical Methods in Animal Science

Genomic selection is currently the method of choice for improving the
genetic potential of selection candidates in livestock breeding
programs. This lecture introduces the reason why regression cannot be
used in genomic selection. Alternatives to regression analysis that are
suitable for genomic selection are presented. The concepts introduced
are illustrated by excersises in R.

The students are familiar with the properties of multiple linear
regression and they are able to analyse simple data sets using
regression methods. The students know why multiple linear regression
cannot be used for genomic selection. The students know the statistical
methods used in genomic selection, such as BLUP-based approaches,
Bayesian procedures and LASSO. The students are able to solve simple
exercise problems using the statistical framework R.

### Genetic Evaluation of Livestock

Swiss routine breeding value estimation/genetic evaluation systems of
cattle, pig, sheep and goats are presented with methods and evaluated
traits. Examples will be demonstrated using the statistical software R.

The students know the theoretical and practical application of breeding
value estimation in Switzerland for cattle, pig, sheep and goats. The
students are able to interpret estimated breeding values.
