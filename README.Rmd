### Exercise Platform
The exercise platform is available under: `http://2-htz.quagzws.com:<PORT>` where `<PORT>` must be replaced by the number that you received by E-Mail. The username is 'rstudio' and the password is also in the E-Mail.


## Description
The following descriptions are taken from the course catalog

### Applied Statistical Methods in Animal Science
Genomic selection is currently the method of choice for improving the genetic potential of selection candidates in livestock breeding programs. This lecture introduces the reason why regression cannot be used in genomic selection. Alternatives to regression analysis that are suitable for genomic selection are presented. The concepts introduced are illustrated by excersises in R.

The students are familiar with the properties of multiple linear regression and they are able to analyse simple data sets using regression methods. The students know why multiple linear regression cannot be used for genomic selection. The students know the statistical methods used in genomic selection, such as BLUP-based approaches, Bayesian procedures and LASSO. The students are able to solve simple exercise problems using the statistical framework R.

### Genetic Evaluation of Livestock
Swiss routine breeding value estimation/genetic evaluation systems of cattle, pig, sheep and goats are presented with methods and evaluated traits. Examples will be demonstrated using the statistical software R.

The students know the theoretical and practical application of breeding value estimation in Switzerland for cattle, pig, sheep and goats. The students are able to interpret estimated breeding values.
