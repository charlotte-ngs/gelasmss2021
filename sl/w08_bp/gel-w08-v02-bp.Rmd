```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::knit_hooks$set(hook_convert_odg = rmdhelp::hook_convert_odg)
```


## Recall

Types of breeding programs:

* focus on selection response (scientific)
* focus on customers and services (political)


## Components of a Breeding Program

```{r bprogdiag, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width="11cm"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/bprogdiag.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/bprogdiag.png")
```


## Example of Implementation

* Assume: beef breeding organisation
* Improvement of animal at production level with respect to economic profitability
* Implementation of scientific breeding program
* Start to design and to develop economic breeding goal
* Combine economically important traits into an aggregate genotype ($H$)
* Use hierarchical structure


## Hierarchical Breeding Program

```{r gel-implbp-hier-bp, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width="11cm"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/gel-implbp-hier-bp.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/gel-implbp-hier-bp.png")
```


## Three Steps To Design Economic Breeding Goal

The following steps are needed to implement a breeding program

1. description of production system
2. modelling profit of a typical herd
3. derive economic values


## Production System

```{r implbp-prodsys, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width="11cm"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/implbp-prodsys.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/implbp-prodsys.png")
```
 

## What is a Production System

* Simulation of production herd
* Collect input parameters (costs, biological parameters, labor, ...) from literature
* Use collected input parameters for simulation
* Run simulation
* Record output quantities (revenue, animals sold)


## Why Production System

* Profit is computed based on revenue and costs
* Characteristics and traits of animals with impact on profitability are found
* Impact of traits on profitability detected by changing input parameters
* Progeny must meet needs of production farms
* Breeders must select parents such that optimal progeny produced for production farms


## Structure of Production System

* Assume a hierarchical structure of the breeding program
* Alternatively: mixed farms in monolithic structure
* Breeding (and possibly multiplier) farms are selling their progeny to production farms


## Example Of Typical Production Farm

```{r example-prodfarm, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width="11cm"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/example-prodfarm.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/example-prodfarm.png")
```


## Traits Of Interest

* Profit ($P$) of production farm determined by revenues ($R$) and costs ($C$)

$$P = R - C$$

* Traits of economic interest influence $P$
* Restrict ourselves to output 
    + age corrected carcass weight (CW)
    + carcass confirmation (CC)
    + carcass fat (CF)
* Above traits will be included in aggregate genotype ($H$)

$$H = a^T \cdot u$$


## Economic Evaluation

```{r gel-implbp-prodsys, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width="11cm"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/gel-implbp-prodsys.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/gel-implbp-prodsys.png")
```


## Economic Values

* ... also known as economic weights
* Change of profit ($P$) due to small change of trait mean ($\mu_x$)
* For trait $x$ with mean $\mu_x$, the economic value $a_x$ is defined as

$$a_x = \frac{\partial P}{\partial \mu_x}$$


## Genetic Evaluation

* Statistical modelling
* Stochastic relationship between genetic background and phenotypic expression
* Contrast: deterministic modelling in physics, e.g. law of gravity


## Statistical Modelling
* In most cases, two steps plus preparation
* Given: dataset on breeding animals containing traits of interest as response variables and predictor variables
* Preparation: do model selection to eliminate unimportant predictor variables
* Steps:
    1. variance components estimation
    2. prediction of breeding values
